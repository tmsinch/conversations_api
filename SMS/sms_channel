# Hello SMS!
Hello!  For this tutorial we will learn how to add an SMS channel to your Sinch Conversations APi Application.  We can do this one of two ways, either programatically via Sinch Conversations API or through the [Sinch online portal](https://dashboard.sinch.com).  Before we begin here are a few items you should already have:

1. You have a text enabled long code or a short code registered with Sinch.
2. You have access to the Sinch dashboard where you manage your long code or short code.
3. You have an SMS *Service Plan ID* and *Secret* to authorize SMS text message requests.

If you are missing any of the above you should begin by registering online at [*Sinch.com*](https://sinch.com).
